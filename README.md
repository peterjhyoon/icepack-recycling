# icepack-recycling

A simple interactive map with markers of the locations of icepack recycling collectors in Korea. The map identifies and initially centers around user's location for convenience to look for nearby recycling collectors, and also includes information for each location (i.e. number of collectors installed, additional comments). Uses KakaoMap API.
